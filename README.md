# Module `12` Challenge: Team Profile Generator

## Description

This application takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, through command-line inputs, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. It's build using JavaScript and Node.js.

## User Story
>
> AS A manager user
I WANT to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info so that everyone in the team have quick access to their colleagues' emails and GitHub profiles.

## Installation

This app requires node.js, so before running it you'll need to download and install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). To use the application simply download the contents of this repo, open the terminal and run `npm intall`. Then, run `node index.js` and the app will begin to asks for the employees inputs.

## Usage

The user inputs a employee name, role, and further employee info, according to what the application is asking. The app runs in Node.js so the inputs are collected via command line interface. Once all the required inputs are collected and the user opts for "Finish building the team", an index.html page is populated with the info collected and shows a profile for each team member in a card-like format.
